The API provides you with a list of items with their respective profit in chaos. PoE FA API is still in development, in the future, you will be able to fetch as much data as you want. For now though, you are restricted with a limited amount of data.

# Usage

For public use, simply click [here](https://poefa.xyz/) to start, if that doesn't work, click the link below.  
[https://poefa.xyz/](https://poefa.xyz/ "https://poefa.xyz/")

Additionally, [https://poefa.xyz/](https://poefa.xyz/ "https://poefa.xyz/") isn't always usable, so instead, you can go to the github hosting [here](https://zappurenfuro.github.io/PoE-FA.github.io/).

After that, clicking the **Calculate Prices** button would give you the results of items with the highest profit margin.
